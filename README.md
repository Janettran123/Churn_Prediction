# Churn_Prediction
- Cleaning, data visualizations, feature engineering, feature selection, and machine learning performed on 54 million rows of data and 52 variables 

- Dataset and output not included due to sensitive information 

- Goal is to create a machine learning model to identify which customer behaviors best predict churn and probability of churn 

- First file involves data cleaning/feature engineering, second file involves machine learning, and third file is code used for data visualization
